#install

The usual.

    npm install --save 4chanapi.js

#usage

There are two functions exported, one to grab the threads on a particular board that match any of an array of keywords, and one that returns the media links for a given thread.  This is done via promises or async/await.

#example

    let chan = require('4chanapi.js')
    
    async function testIt() {
    let threads = await chan.threadsWithTopics("v", ["rpg", "metal gear"])
    console.log(threads)
    let results = await chan.threadMediaLinks(threads[0].url)
    console.log(results)
    }
    
    testIt()
    
In the above example `threads` would be an array of objects like this:
 
 	[ { url: 'https://a.4cdn.org/v/thread/123.json',
    semantic_url: 'do-people-actually-find-puzzle-maps-in-rpgs-fun' },
    { url: 'https://a.4cdn.org/v/thread/321.json',
    semantic_url: 'best-story-in-gaming-with-xenogears' } ]
    
The `url` is the url of the json api endpoint for that thread, as used by the other function.  The `semantic_url` is the slugified thread title, suitable for use as a folder name.  The output of `results` is an array of simple string values representing the pictures/webms in the thread.

There's no function provided to actually download the images, that's up to you.
